XElemNet: Towards Explainable AI for Deep Neural Networks in Materials Science
This repository contains the source codes of using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to analyze [ElemNet](https://github.com/NU-CUCIS/ElemNet). 
To explore the interpretability of ElemNet, the interpretation of ElemNet is conducted through both post-hoc and transparency explanations.

## Source Files
Here is a brief description of the codes:
* [get_labels](): code for generating the labels from trained ElemNet
* [xelemnet](): code for applying a suite of explainable AI (XAI) techniques for both post-hoc and transparency explanations to the ElemNet model

## Development team
The code was developed by Kewei Wang from the CUCIS group at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northwestern University.
